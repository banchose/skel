+Is it possible to have a drone go into the clouds in the usa

# 2025-02-11 19:59:20.228808
+Ok, how about, I saw a video of a white light blinking behind a cloud.  The commentator found it very mysterious.  But can't drones be equiped to do this

+And are you ok with cloudformation

+I have a eks cluster.  I want to put the nginx ingress controller on it. Then I want to create an internal (non-public) NLB.  Could you give me a template that contain just the NLB resources.

+I would like that again but, I have a second az, I needed it for eks I think, but I do not want to use the other AZ yet.  This is all single az.  I just need the NLB because eks needs it for the nginx ingress

+HOw do you know what address to hit on the NLB?

+on prem, we have an nginx ingress.  It uses metallb. MetalLB publishes an ip.  I use that for the ingress.  I  have it in my dns as say app1.example.net on https.  What does this look like with eks and an nlb

+Ok, so I guess I would put the certificate in the cloudformation and then I am guessing I manually put it in aws secrets?

# 2025-02-11 20:27:24.005711
+but it is for one certificate.  Do I really need an aws service.  Or can I just store it in another way.  Is the ssl cert still configured in the ingress.  In that case I will manually create it
