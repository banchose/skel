This router configuration provides a clear answer! Your application is using Pattern 1 (Frontend-Only Flow) for Okta authentication. Here's the evidence:

1. **Direct Use of Okta SDK Components**: 
   ```javascript
   import { LoginCallback, navigationGuard } from "@okta/okta-vue"
   ```
   You're importing and using Okta's `LoginCallback` component directly in your routes, which indicates that the frontend is handling the entire authentication flow.

2. **LoginCallback Route Configuration**:
   ```javascript
   {
     path: "/login/callback",
     name: "callback",
     meta: {
       requiresAlbBuf: false,
     },
     component: LoginCallback,
   }
   ```
   This route is configured to use Okta's SDK component rather than a custom component that would send the code to your backend.

3. **Use of NavigationGuard**:
   While it's commented out (`// router.beforeEach(navigationGuard)`), the import of navigationGuard from the Okta SDK suggests the application was designed to use Okta's frontend-based authentication flow.

4. **Token Handling in Router Guard**:
   ```javascript
   router.beforeEach((to, from) => {
     store.dispatch("fetchIdToken")
     const getGroups = store.getters["getGroups"]
     const getIsLoggedIn = store.getters["getIsLoggedIn"]
     // ...
   })
   ```
   This shows the frontend is directly fetching the ID token and checking authentication state, which aligns with Pattern 1.

The flow in your application works like this:

1. User clicks login and is redirected to Okta
2. User authenticates with Okta
3. Okta redirects back to your app at `/login/callback` with an authorization code
4. The Okta `LoginCallback` component handles the code exchange with Okta directly
5. Tokens are stored in the frontend (likely in your Vuex store)
6. Your custom router guard then uses these tokens to check authentication and route the user

This confirms the frontend is handling the entire authentication flow, including the token exchange with Okta. The backend is likely only validating the tokens when they're sent with API requests, not participating in the initial authentication flow.

The only way this could be Pattern 2 is if the Okta `LoginCallback` component was configured to use a custom token endpoint that points to your backend instead of Okta directly, but there's no evidence of that in the code you've shared.
