# AWS Route53 Resolver Quick Troubleshooting Guide

## Core Resolver Concepts

**Route53 Resolver:** DNS service that handles queries from VPCs, can forward to on-prem DNS or other targets

## Flow of Resolver Rules

1. **Creation:** Rules exist in central "Network" account
2. **Sharing:** Shared via AWS RAM (Resource Access Manager) to the Organization
3. **Association:** Each account associates shared rules with their VPCs
4. **Resolution Flow:** When DNS query matches pattern → forwarded to target IPs in rule

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting Steps

| Issue | Check These | Commands |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **DNS not resolving** | 1. Rule exists<br>2. Rule is shared<br>3. Rule is associated<br>4. Target IPs reachable | `aws route53resolver list-resolver-rules`<br>`aws ram list-resources`<br>`aws route53resolver list-resolver-rule-associations` |
| **Rule exists but not working** | 1. Target IPs correct<br>2. Security Groups allow DNS<br>3. Domain pattern matches | Check rule configuration in Network account |
| **Can't see shared rule** | 1. RAM sharing setup<br>2. Account is in share list | Check RAM console in Network account |
| **Cache issues** | 1. TTL settings<br>2. Local DNS cache | Check rule's TTL settings |

## Checking Resolver Path

```
VPC DNS Query → Route53 Resolver → Match Rule? → Yes → Forward to Target IPs
                                              → No → Use standard resolution
```

## Key Resolver Components

- **Inbound Endpoints:** Allow on-prem to query VPC resources (IP addresses in your VPC)
- **Outbound Endpoints:** Allow VPC resources to query external DNS (like your on-prem DNS)
- **Resolver Rules:** Define which queries go where

When troubleshooting, start by verifying the rule exists and is associated, then check connectivity to target IPs.
## The Steps

1. You have a forwarding rule for `corp.healthresearch.org` pointing to `10.1.100.100` and `10.1.100.101`
2. You have a reverse lookup rule for `1.10.in-addr.arpa`
3. But no rule for the base domain `healthresearch.org`

# Check resource shares created by networking account
aws ram list-resource-shares \
    --resource-owner SELF \
    --profile net
```

## Check Shared Resources in the Networking Account

```bash
# Check which resolver rules are shared
aws ram list-resources \
    --resource-owner SELF \
    --resource-type "route53resolver:ResolverRule" \
    --profile net
```

## Check RAM Shares in the Test Account

```bash
# List resource shares available to the test account
aws ram list-resource-shares \
    --resource-owner OTHER-ACCOUNTS
```
aws route53resolver associate-resolver-rule \
    --resolver-rule-id rslvr-rr-4ded99599e8e47228 \
    --vpc-id vpc-0c4facf35faa61076 \
    --profile net

aws route53resolver get-resolver-rule \
    --resolver-rule-id rslvr-rr-4ded99599e8e47228 \
    --profile net
