# Understanding the Callback URL in OAuth Flow

Only the backend does the authentication and handles the tokens

The most important takeaway is that after a user authenticates with Okta, Okta will redirect back to ${HOSTNAME}${BASENAME}/login/callback with authorization codes or tokens. Your application needs to have a **route** and **component** set up to handle this callback and complete the authentication process.


You've hit on an important clarification about callback URLs in the OAuth/OIDC flow. Let me explain exactly what's happening:

## What the Callback URL Actually Is

The callback URL (also called redirect URI) serves **both** purposes:

1. **It is where the browser redirects the user** after authentication with Okta
2. **It is where Okta delivers the authorization code** as a query parameter

## The Complete Flow in Detail

1. User clicks "Login with Okta" in your application
2. Your app redirects to Okta's authorization endpoint with parameters:
   - client_id
   - redirect_uri (the callback URL)
   - response_type (typically "code")
   - scope (e.g., "openid profile email")
   - state (security parameter)

3. User authenticates with Okta (username/password, possibly MFA)

4. Okta redirects the user's browser back to your callback URL with parameters:
   ```
   https://your-app.com/callback?code=abc123&state=xyz789
   ```

5. Your app's server code at the callback URL:
   - Verifies the state parameter matches what was sent
   - Extracts the authorization code
   - Makes a server-to-server POST request to Okta's token endpoint
   - Exchanges the code for actual tokens (ID token, access token)
   - Usually sets a session cookie or other authentication state
   - Redirects the user to the appropriate page in your application

## Clarifications About Callback URLs

1. **It's not just for the code** - It's the actual location where the user's browser lands after authentication.

2. **Browser flow and code delivery happen together** - The browser is redirected to the callback URL, and the authorization code is attached as a query parameter.

3. **What happens after the callback is application-controlled** - After your application processes the callback, it will usually:
   - Create a session for the user
   - Redirect them to a post-login destination page
   - Display appropriate UI based on their identity/permissions

4. **Networking implications** - This is why the callback URL must be:
   - Publicly accessible (so Okta can redirect to it)
   - Registered exactly in your Okta application settings
   - Capable of receiving and processing HTTP requests with query parameters

This is why callback URL issues can be problematic from a networking perspective - if there are firewalls, load balancers, or other network configurations preventing proper access to the callback URL, the authentication flow breaks down.

Does this clarify how the callback URL functions in the authentication process?
