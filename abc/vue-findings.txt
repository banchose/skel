### Key Findings:

1. The Vite config has the correct base path: `base: '/pisal/'` ✅
2. In your `.env` file, you have `VITE_BASE_URL=/pisal` (without trailing slash) ⚠️
3. The router is using `history: createWebHistory(import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL)` which needs the correct base path

### The Issue:

The primary issue is that your `VITE_BASE_URL` is set to `/pisal` (missing a trailing slash) in the environment file, but Vue Router 4 expects the base path to have a trailing slash when used with `createWebHistory()`.

### Solution:

1. **Update the `.env` file to include the trailing slash**:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Update the VITE_BASE_URL to include trailing slash
sed -i 's|VITE_BASE_URL=/pisal|VITE_BASE_URL=/pisal/|' ~/temp/hrigit/pisal/.env
```

2. **Ensure the router configuration is consistent**:

The router code has a redundancy - it's setting both `history: createWebHistory(import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL)` and `base: ${BASENAME}`. The second line is unnecessary since the base path is already set in `createWebHistory()`. You can keep both lines if you prefer, but they should be consistent.

3. **Rebuild and redeploy the application**:

After making these changes, rebuild the application and redeploy it to your AWS EKS cluster.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd ~/temp/hrigit/pisal

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy the built application to your AWS EKS cluster
# (Your specific deployment commands here)
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that all components (Vite build, Vue Router, and environment variables) consistently use the base path `/pisal/` with a trailing slash.

The trailing slash is important for Vue Router 4's `createWebHistory()` function as it uses this to correctly resolve routes and assets relative to the base path.
