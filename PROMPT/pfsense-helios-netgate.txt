Native Packet Flow Data Export for NetFlow/IPFIX
Starting with pfSense Plus software version 24.03 the firewall can directly export NetFlow v5 and IPFIX traffic flow
data to one or more collectors using the pflow(4) feature in PF. The data is collected directly from firewall states and
does not require a separate daemon, service, or add-on package.

Firewall Packet Flow Data
Capabilities For Netgate Hardware
There are also several capabilities in pfSense Plus software that are unique to the appliance hardware that Netgate sells
and supports.
These include:
• ARM64 support (for Netgate’s ARM-based appliances)
• The Firmware Update add-on package
• MMC Utilities package
• Support for specialized hardware such as status LEDs, reset buttons, switches, and hardware watchdog devices
• Default optimized configurations for Netgate hardware appliances
2.3 Why FreeBSD?
Numerous factors came under consideration when choosing a base operating system for the project. This section
outlines the primary reasons for selecting FreeBSD.
2.3.1 Wireless Support
Wireless support is a key feature for some users. In 2004, wireless support in OpenBSD was very limited compared
to FreeBSD. OpenBSD did not support drivers or security protocols and offered no plans for their implementation. To
this day, FreeBSD surpasses the wireless capabilities of OpenBSD.
2.3.2 Network Performance
Network performance in FreeBSD is significantly better than that of OpenBSD. For small to mid-sized deployments,
this generally does not matter; upper scalability is the primary issue in OpenBSD. One pfSense® developer managing
several hundred OpenBSD firewalls using PF was forced to switch his high load systems to PF on FreeBSD to handle the
high packets per second rate required by portions of his network. The network performance in OpenBSD has improved
since 2004, but limitations still exist.
Multiprocessor support for PF in FreeBSD allows for greater scalability and is utilized by pfSense software as seen in
this network performance analysis: https://github.com/gvnn3/netperf/blob/master/Documentation/netperf.pdf.
2.3. Why FreeBSD? 8
The pfSense Documentation, © 2025 Electric Sheep Fencing LLC & Rubicon Communications LLC
2.3.3 Familiarity and ease of fork
The code for m0n0wall was based on FreeBSD, and pfSense software forked from m0n0wall. Changing the base
operating system would require prohibitively large modifications and could have introduced limitations from other
operating systems, requiring features to be removed or altered.
2.3.4 Alternative Operating System Support
There are no plans to support any other base operating systems at this time.
2.4 Common Deployments
pfSense® software can meet the needs of nearly any type and size of network environment, from a SOHO to datacenter
environments. This section outlines the most common deployments.
2.4.1 Perimeter Firewall
The most common deployment of pfSense software is a perimeter firewall. pfSense software accommodates networks
requiring multiple Internet connections, multiple LAN networks, and multiple DMZ networks. BGP (Border Gateway
Protocol), connection redundancy, and load balancing capabilities are configurable as well.
See also:
These advanced features are further described in Routing and Multiple WAN Connections.
2.4.2 LAN or WAN Router
pfSense software configured as a LAN or WAN router and perimeter firewall is a common deployment in small net-
works. LAN and WAN routing are separate roles in larger networks.
LAN Router
pfSense software is a proven solution for connecting multiple internal network segments. This is most commonly de-
ployed with VLANs configured with 802.1Q trunking, described more in Virtual LANs (VLANs). Multiple Ethernet
interfaces are also used in some environments. High-volume LAN traffic environments with fewer filtering require-
ments may need layer 3 switches or ASIC-based routers instead.
WAN Router
pfSense software is a great solution for Internet Service Providers. It offers all the functionality required by most
networks at a much lower price point than other commercial offerings.
2.4. Common Deployments 9
The pfSense Documentation, © 2025 Electric Sheep Fencing LLC & Rubicon Communications LLC
2.4.3 Special Purpose Appliances
pfSense software can be utilized for less common deployment scenarios as a stand-alone appliance. Examples include:
VPN appliance, Sniffer appliance, and DHCP server appliance.
VPN Appliance
pfSense software installed as a separate Virtual Private Network appliance adds VPN capabilities without disrupting
the existing firewall infrastructure, and includes multiple VPN protocols.
Sniffer Appliance
pfSense software offers a web interface for the tcpdump packet analyzer. The captured .cap files are downloaded and
analyzed in Wireshark.
See also:
For more information on using the packet capture features, see Packet Capturing.
DHCP Server Appliance
pfSense software can be deployed strictly as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server, however, there are limita-
tions of the pfSense software GUI for advanced configuration of the ISC DHCP daemon.
See also:
For more information on configuring the DHCP service on pfSense, see DHCP.
2.5 Interface Naming Terminology
All interfaces on pfSense® software can be assigned any name desired, but they all start with default names: WAN,
LAN, and OPT.
2.5.1 WAN
Short for Wide Area Network, WAN is the untrusted public network outside the firewall. In other words, the WAN
interface is the firewall’s connection to the Internet or other upstream network. In a multi-WAN deployment, WAN is
the first or primary Internet connection.
At a minimum, the firewall must have one interface, and that is WAN.
2.5.2 LAN
Short for Local Area Network, LAN is commonly the private side of a firewall. It typically utilizes a private IP address
scheme for local clients. In small deployments, LAN is typically the only internal interface.
2.5. Interface Naming Terminology 10
The pfSense Documentation, © 2025 Electric Sheep Fencing LLC & Rubicon Communications LLC
2.5.3 OPT
OPT or Optional interfaces refer to any additional interfaces other than WAN and LAN. OPT interfaces can be addi-
tional LAN segments, WAN connections, DMZ segments, interconnections to other private networks, and so on.
2.5.4 DMZ
Short for the military term demilitarized zone, DMZ refers to the buffer between a protected area and a war zone.
In networking, it is an area where public servers are reachable from the Internet via the WAN but isolated from the
LAN. The DMZ keeps the systems in other segments from being endangered if the network is compromised, while
also protecting hosts in the DMZ from other local segments and the Internet in general.
Warning: Some companies misuse the term “DMZ” in their firewall products as a reference to 1:1 NAT on the
WAN IP address which exposes a host on the LAN. For more information, see 1:1 NAT on the WAN IP, aka “DMZ”
on Consumer Gateways.
2.5.5 FreeBSD interface naming
The name of a FreeBSD interface starts with the name of its network driver. It is then followed by a number starting at
0 that increases incrementally by one for each additional interface sharing that driver. For example, a common driver
used by Intel gigabit network interface cards is igb. The first such card in a firewall will be igb0, the second is igb1,
and so on. Other common driver names include cxl (Chelsio 10G), em (Also Intel 1G), ix (Intel 10G), bge (various
Broadcom chipsets), amongst numerous others. If a system mixes an Intel card and a Chelsio card, the interfaces will
be igb0 and cxl0 respectively.

Interface assignments and naming are further covered in Installing and Upgrading.

2.7 Comparison to Commercial Alternatives
The question of security and support vs. commercial alternatives comes up from time to time. The history of this
project since its inception in 2004 proves we’re as secure as any, and better than many, commercial alternatives. The
experiences of our customers proves not only can we match the service of any commercial firewall vendor, we exceed
it. This page serves to debunk the common myths when comparing to commercial alternatives.
2.7.1 “Hardware” firewalls are better myth
Commercial firewall companies’ marketing departments have done a fine job ingraining the myth of “hardware fire-
walls” into some people’s minds. The reality is there is no such thing as a “hardware firewall.” All firewalls are hardware
that runs software. Most commercial firewalls are based on BSD (same as pfSense®) or Linux. Numerous commercial
firewalls run many of the same underlying software programs that pfSense software uses. Many commercial alternatives
run on x86 hardware that’s no different from what people use for pfSense software. In fact many people have loaded
pfSense software on hardware that used to run their commercial firewall, including WatchGuard, Nortel, Barracuda
and more.
2.7.2 Open source is insecure myth
Some people are of the mindset that because the source is open, it’s insecure because everyone can see how it works.
Anyone who has paid any attention to security over the past 20 years knows the absurdity of that statement. No software
relies on the obscurity of source code for security. If there was any truth in that, Microsoft Windows would be the most
secure OS ever created, when the reality is all the open source operating systems (all the BSDs and Linux) have security
track records that are worlds better than Windows’. History proves the same applies to any software. Internet Explorer
is continually hit with major security holes that many times take weeks to patch while they’re being exploited in the
wild, while open source browsers Firefox, Chrome and others have had significantly better security track records.
The widespread UPnP vulnerabilities announced in 2013 affecting over 300 commercial products is another good
example. The vendors of hundreds of commercial products made extremely basic security mistakes, shipping with
absurdly insecure defaults, and shipping outdated software. That’s never been an issue with pfSense software. That’s
only one example of where pfSense software has done a better job than many commercial vendors

2.10 Contact with Netgate Servers
For several essential and optional services, such as checking for updates, installing updates and packages, and the Auto
Config Backup service, pfSense® software makes outgoing connections to servers owned and operated by Netgate.
This document identifies these connections with an explanation of why it makes contact, what is transmitted in both
directions, and how administrators can control these operations.
Each of the services described also generates server logs which Netgate discards after 365 days (1 year). Netgate uses
these logs to monitor performance, detect problems, and gather usage statistics while also satisfying GDPR require-
ments.
2.10.1 Support contract information
Netgate offers a number of support options for both pfSense and TNSR software users. See https://www.netgate.com/
support/ for details.
If administrators activate the Netgate Service and Support widget on the pfSense software GUI Dashboard, pfSense
software will query Netgate servers to obtain the current support status, a list of web links, and other information to
help administrators make the best use of their support options. This query occurs no more than once every 24 hours.
Note: This widget is active by default on installations of pfSense Plus software, but it can be removed at any time. It
is not active by default on pfSense CE software.
Support contracts are tied to individual devices so Netgate must positively identify these devices when providing ser-
vice. This is not easy to do: Serial numbers are not consistent across different hardware manufacturers and building a
firewall running pfSense software from scratch on “white box” hardware is common. To overcome this problem and
allow purchasers of Netgate support services to be sure that no one can “spoof” their support contract, Netgate uses a
“Netgate Device ID” (NDI) which is displayed on the dashboard and in console/ssh menu banner.
The NDI is a hashed SHA256 value based on available information on the system. Netgate cannot reverse engineer
from the NDI how it was generated, what information was gathered, or what values were used. Even if it were practical
to reverse-hash SHA256 (it is not) only a string of meaningless characters would result. Netgate knows only that NDI
“xyz” has been assigned to support contract “abc”.
Information that is transmitted via the HTTPS connection to Netgate servers:
• Netgate ID
Server log information retained by Netgate for up to 1 year, then deleted:
• IP address
2.10. Contact with Netgate Servers 15

If administrators prefer not to have pfSense software transmit this information, remove or do not install the Netgate
Service and Support Dashboard widget.

• Available Widgets
2.10.2 Software Updates and Packages
To check for updates to pfSense software, navigate to System > Update or, if the System Information widget is active
and configured to check for updates, visit the Dashboard. To install new packages or check for updates to installed
packages, navigate to System > Package Manager.
These actions cause pfSense software to connect to Netgate servers and update its repository information and package
metadata. The first connection is made to establish authorization level and request a list of any available updates.
To determine which updates are available for a given installation, pfSense software transmits the architecture (amd64,
ARM64, etc.) to the web service along with a list of the installed software components and their versions. The server
can then respond with a list of any available updates (For example “stable”, “development”, etc.) that are appropriate
for the architecture type and authorized for the end-user installation (plus, community edition, etc.).
Similar queries are made when installing new packages.
pfSense software will request updated repository information any time an administrator navigates to System > Package
Manager, System > Update or when the System Information Dashboard widget is active and the option to Disable
the dashboard auto-update check is unchecked under System > Update on the Update Settings tab (Dashboard
Check). This option is unchecked by default.
Additionally, pfSense software automatically updates this metadata once per day. The timing is randomized and can
be anywhere from 1:00 A.M. local time up to 24 hours later.
Information that is transmitted via the HTTPS connection to Netgate servers:
• Netgate ID
• Serial Number
• pfSense software and installed package versions
• Architecture
• Configured language (locale)
• Platform information (Netgate products, virtualization platform, cloud provider, etc.)
Server log information retained by Netgate for up to 1 year, then deleted:
• IP address
• Netgate ID
• Serial Number
• pfSense software and installed package versions
• Architecture
• Platform information (Netgate products, virtualization platform, cloud provider, etc.)

2.10.3 Auto Config Backup (ACB)
Netgate offers an automatic configuration backup service, known as Auto Config Backup or ACB, which is free for
anyone to use.
When pfSense software makes a backup via ACB, either automatically or manually, it encrypts the config.xml con-
figuration file using AES-256 and a key provided by the administrator with options suitable for file encryption.
pfSense software then transmits this encrypted file to https://acb.netgate.com where it is stored for future retrieval.
pfSense software also transmits a unique and random “device key” to privately identify which backups belong to a
given installation.
This device key must be unique to each firewall backing up its configuration. To do this the key is automatically
generated by taking the SHA256 hash of the SSH service keys on the installation. This allows ACB to reliably and
properly identify ownership of each backup in an anonymous way.
The encryption key never leaves the firewall in plain text. It exists within the config.xml data, but has already been
encrypted. Netgate cannot decrypt any stored configuration file, nor link it to any particular firewall serial number or
identifier.
The ACB service is not active by default. If administrators prefer not to have this information transmitted, disable or
do not configure the Automatic Configuration Backup feature.
Information that is transmitted via the HTTPS connection to Netgate servers:
• Netgate ID
• Device key
• AES-256 encrypted configuration
• Timestamp
• Optional hint (in case the device key is lost)
• pfSense software version (in case the ACB data format changes in future versions)
Server log information retained by Netgate for up to 1 year, then deleted:
• IP address
• Netgate ID
• pfSense software version

2.10.4 Bogon Network List Updates
Bogon networks are those which should never be seen on the Internet, including reserved and unassigned IP address
space.
If any interfaces are configured to Block Bogon Networks, then shortly after initial installation and once per month
after that, pfSense software will contact Netgate servers to obtain an updated list of Bogon Networks.
The update script runs at 3:00 A.M. local time, and sleeps a random amount of time up to 12 hours before performing
the update.
The frequency of Bogon network updates can be adjusted using the Update Frequency option for bogons under System
> Advanced on the Firewall & NAT tab. Updates may be performed on a Daily, Weekly, or Monthly basis.
Information that is transmitted via the HTTPS connection to Netgate servers:
• pfSense software version
• Netgate ID (optional)
• Release (plus/community)
Server log information retained by Netgate for up to 365 days, then deleted:
• IP address
• pfSense software version
• Netgate ID (optional)
• Release
The Bogon update can either send or omit the Netgate ID based on the Netgate Device ID option under Installation

Legacy
Uses RC2-40 and SHA1 to encrypt the archive. Avoid using this level if at all possible as it is
extremely weak by modern standards. This was the previous default on older versions of pfSense
software (Plus 22.05, CE 2.6.0).
Warning: OpenSSL 3.0 will not read PKCS #12 archives encrypted with this method as it
has deprecated this type of weak encryption.
• Click the Export Private Key button to export the private key for the certificate.
The password-protected file will download with the descriptive name of the certificate as the file name, with the
extension .key.
• Click the PKCS #12 button to export a PCKS #12 file containing the CA, certificate, and private key
together.
The password-protected file will download with the descriptive name of the certificate as the file name, with the
extension .p12.
13.3.5 Export a Certificate Signing Request
• Navigate to System > Certificates, Certificates tab
• Locate the CSR entry in the list
• Click the icon at the end of its row to export the CSR.
The file will download with the descriptive name of the CSR as the file name, with the extension .req.
13.3.6 Remove a Certificate
To remove a certificate, first it must be removed from active use.
• Check areas that can use a certificate, such as the GUI options, OpenVPN, IPsec, and packages
Note: In most cases, the areas using a certificate are noted in the In Use column of the certificate list. This does
not necessarily include all areas, especially if the certificate is used by a package.
• Remove entries using the certificate, or choose another certificate
• Navigate to System > Certificates, Certificates tab
• Locate the certificate to delete in the list
• Click at the end of the row for the certificate
Note: This icon will only be present if the certificate is not in use.
• Click OK on the confirmation dialog
13.3. Certificate Management 647
The pfSense Documentation, © 2025 Electric Sheep Fencing LLC & Rubicon Communications LLC
13.3.7 Renew a Certificate
To renew a certificate entry:
• Navigate to System > Certificates, Certificates tab
• Locate the certificate entry in the list
• Click at the end of the row for the certificate
• Follow the rest of the renewal procedure as described in Renew or Reissue a CA or Certificate
13.3.8 User Certificates
If a VPN is being used that requires user certificates, they may be created in one of several ways. The exact method
depends on where the authentication for the VPN is being performed and whether the certificate already exists.
No Authentication or External Authentication
If there is no user authentication, or if the user authentication is being performed on an external server (RADIUS,
LDAP, etc.) then make a user certificate like any other certificate described earlier. Ensure that User Certificate is
selected for the Certificate Type and set the Common Name to match the username.
Local Authentication
If user authentication is being performed by this firewall, the user certificate can be made inside the User Manager. The
User Manager can create a certificate while creating a user, or it can add certificates to existing users. These processes
are documented at Manage Local Users.
13.4 Renew or Reissue a CA or Certificate
When a CA or certificate expires it must be replaced, renewed, or reissued. The GUI can Renew or Reissue a certificate
using a semi-automatic process. This process can retain the existing properties of the CA or certificate, but results in a
freshly signed copy. This process can also make changes to the lifetime, keys, and digest so they meet current security
best practices.
The new copy of this certificate must be distributed to the intended target as it was originally.
13.4.1 Certificate Properties
The Renew or Reissue page displays information about the entry, including:
Subject
The subject of the certificate, containing its Distinguished Name (DN)
Serial
The serial number of the certificate.
Subject Key ID
Fingerprint of the certificate key.
13.4. Renew or Reissue a CA or Certificate 648
The pfSense Documentation, © 2025 Electric Sheep Fencing LLC & Rubicon Communications LLC
Certificate Type
Either User or Server, if known.
Issued By
The CA which signed the certificate (Name and DN)
13.4.2 Renew or Reissue Options
There are two options available which control what happens when the certificate is renewed:
Reuse Key
When set (default), the existing key on the certificate is retained. When unset, a fresh key will be
created when the certificate is reissued.
Reuse Serial
Set this option to retain the existing serial number when reissuing. Uncheck to generate a new serial.
Retaining the serial when renewing a CA allows existing certificates to remain valid, though some
clients may not respect the new CA if the serial does not change.
Similarly, certificates should have a new serial every time they are renewed, or some peers will reject
them.
The exact behavior depends on the service and clients, but generally speaking it is safe to reuse the
serial on a CA but not safe to reuse the serial on a server or user certificate. For example, OpenVPN is
OK with reusing the serial number on a CA when renewing, while web browsers will reject changing
a server certificate, even self-signed, if the serial does not change when the contents of the certificate
change.
Strict Security
When set, upgrades the security of the certificate to meet current standards.
The Renew or Reissue page performs a security analysis on the certificate, comparing its current
values for Lifetime, Digest, and RSA Key size with current best security practices. This analysis is
printed at the bottom of the page. If any of the values are weak, the Would Change column in the
analysis indicates Yes.
13.4.3 Renew or Reissue Example
To start the renewal process, first locate the CA or certificate to renew:
• Navigate to System > Certificates
• Navigate to the CAs tab for CA entries, or the Certificates tab for certificates
• Locate the entry to renew in the list
• Click at the end of the row for the certificate to load the Renew or Reissue page for the certificate
Note: The icon only appears for entries which have been signed by an internal CA on the firewall.
• Review the contents of the page
• Set the Renew or Reissue Options as desired
13.4. Renew or Reissue a CA or Certificate 649
The pfSense Documentation, © 2025 Electric Sheep Fencing LLC & Rubicon Communications LLC
• Click Renew/Reissue
• Click OK to confirm the action
When the process completes, the certificate entry is updated in the configuration.
Note: If the certificate is in use by a service on the firewall, the associated service(s) are restarted automatically.
For user certificates, the updated certificate must be exported and transmitted to the user. If a new key was generated
by the renewal process, it must also be transmitted to the user.
13.5 Certificate Revocation List Management
Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are a part of the X.509 system that publish lists of certificates that must no longer
be trusted. These certificates may have been compromised or otherwise need to be invalidated. An application using a
CA, such as OpenVPN may optionally use a CRL so it can verify connecting client certificates. A CRL is generated
and signed against a CA using its private key, so in order to create or add certificates to a CRL in the GUI, the private
key of the CA must be present. If the CA is managed externally and the private key for the CA is not on the firewall, a
CRL may still be generated outside the firewall and imported.
The traditional way to use a CRL is to only have one CRL per CA and only add invalid certificates to that CRL. The
GUI, however, supports multiple CRLs for a single CA. In OpenVPN, different CRLs may be chosen for separate VPN
instances. This could be used, for example, to prevent a specific certificate from connecting to one instance while
allowing it to connect to another. For IPsec, all CRLs are consulted and there is no selection as currently exists with
OpenVPN.
Certificate Revocation Lists are managed from System > Certificates, on the Certificate Revocation tab.
From this screen CRL entries can be added, edited, exported, or deleted. The list shows all existing CRLs and an option
to add a new CRL from a given CA. The screen also indicates whether the CRL is internal or external (imported), and
it shows a count of how many certificates have been revoked on each CRL, and indicates if the CRL is in use.
13.5.1 Create a new Certificate Revocation List
To create a new CRL:
• Navigate to System > Certificates, Certificate Revocation tab
• Select a CA from the drop-down menu under the Create or Import a New Certificate Revocation List
• Click Add at the end of the row to create a new CRL
• Set the Method to Create an Internal Certificate Revocation List
• Enter a Descriptive Name for the CRL
This is used to identify this CRL in lists around the GUI. It’s usually best to include a reference to the name of
the CA and/or the purpose of the CRL.
• Enter the Lifetime value as a number of days for which the CRL should be valid
The default value is 730 days (2 years).
13.5. Certificate Revocation List Management 650

Note: In practice, this limit would almost never be reached as the CRL is regenerated any time the CRL is edited
or when a service which utilizes a CRL is reconfigured.
Note: The system attempts to prevent using too large a value for the lifetime to ensure the date doesn’t overflow.
On 32-bit platforms, the limit is before the UNIX time rollover in 2038. On other platforms, the limit is before
UTC time 2-digit dates roll over in 2050. See Redmine #13424 for details. Systems reporting an expired CRL
can work around the error by making a new CRL with a lower lifetime or by applying a patch on that Redmine
issue.
• Click Save
The browser will be return to the CRL list, and the new entry will be shown there.
13.5.2 Import an Existing Certificate Revocation List
To import a CRL from an external source:
• Navigate to System > Certificates, Certificate Revocation tab
• Select a CA from the drop-down menu under the Create or Import a New Certificate Revocation List
• Click Add at the end of the row to create a new CRL
• Set the Method to Import an Existing Certificate Revocation List
• Enter a Descriptive Name for the CRL
This is used to identify this CRL in lists around the GUI. It’s usually best to include a reference to the name of
the CA and/or the purpose of the CRL.
• Enter the CRL data
This is typically in a file ending in .crl. It would be plain text data enclosed in a block such as:
-----BEGIN X509 CRL-----
[A bunch of random-looking base64-encoded data]
-----END X509 CRL-----
• Click Save to finish the import process.
If an error appears, follow the on-screen instructions to correct the problem and then try again. The most common
error is not pasting in the right portion of the CRL data. Make sure to enter the entire block, including the beginning
header and ending footer around the encoded data.
Warning: New entries cannot be added to imported CRLs. To update an imported CRL, see Updating an Imported
Certificate Revocation List.

13.5.3 Export a Certificate Revocation List
• Navigate to System > Certificates, Certificate Revocation tab
• Locate the CRL to delete in the list
• Click the icon
The file will download with the descriptive name of the CRL as the file name, and the extension .crl.
13.5.4 Delete a Certificate Revocation List
• Check areas that can use a CRL, such as IPsec and OpenVPN
Note: In most cases, the areas using a CRL are noted in the In Use column of the CRL list. This does not
necessarily include all areas, especially if the CRL is used by a package.
• Remove entries using the CRL, or choose another CRL instead
• Navigate to System > Certificates, Certificate Revocation tab
• Locate the CRL to delete in the list
• Click the icon at the end of the row for the CRL
Note: This icon will only be present if the CRL is not in use.
• Click OK on the confirmation dialog
If an error appears, follow the on-screen instructions to correct the problem and then try again.
13.5.5 Revoke a Certificate
A CRL isn’t useful unless it contains revoked certificates. A certificate is revoked by adding the certificate to a CRL,
or by entering its serial number.
• Navigate to System > Certificates, Certificate Revocation tab
• Locate the CRL to edit in the list
• Click the icon at the end of the row for the CRL
The GUI lists any revoked certificates on the CRL, and a control to add new ones.
• Select a Reason from the drop-down list to indicate why the certificate is being revoked
This information doesn’t affect the validity of the certificate it is merely informational in nature. This option may
be left at the default value.
• To revoke by certificate, select the certificate(s) from the Revoke Certificates list
Note: Multiple certificates can be revoked at once by selecting all of them in the list.
13.5. Certificate Revocation List Management 652

• To revoke by serial number, enter one or more certificate serial numbers separated by spaces in the Revoke by
Serial field
• Click Add and the certificate(s) will be added to the CRL
Note: Certificates can be revoked by selection and by serial at the same time.
After adding a certificate, the CRL will be re-written if it is currently in use by any VPN instances so that the CRL
changes will be immediately active.
13.5.6 Removing a Certificate from a CRL
Certificates can be removed from the CRL when editing a CRL:
• Navigate to System > Certificates, Certificate Revocation tab
• Locate the CRL to edit in the list
• Click the icon at the end of the row for the CRL
• Find the certificate in the list and click the icon to remove it from the CRL
• Click OK on the confirmation dialog
After removing a certificate, the CRL will be re-written if it is currently in use by any VPN instances so that the CRL
changes will be immediately active.
13.5.7 Updating an Imported Certificate Revocation List
To update an imported CRL:
• Navigate to System > Certificates, Certificate Revocation tab.
• Locate the CRL to edit in the list
• Click the icon at the end of the row for the CRL
• Enter a new copy of the CRL Data
• Click Save
After updating the imported CRL, it will be re-written if it is currently in use by any VPN instances so that the CRL
changes will be immediately active

Alias Usage
When a user types a letter into a form input which supports aliases, the GUI displays a list of matching aliases. The
user can then select the desired alias from the list or type its name out completely.
Note: Alias autocompletion is not case-sensitive, but it is restricted by type. For example, the GUI will autocomplete
a Network or Host type alias for a network field, but not a Port alias. Likewise, the GUI will autocomplete a Port alias
in a port field, but not a Network alias.
Figure Autocompletion of Hosts Alias shows how the WebServers alias, configured as shown in Figure Example Hosts
Alias, can be used in the Destination field when adding or editing a firewall rule.
• Edit the firewall rule
• Set the Destination drop-down to Address or Alias
• Then type the first letter of the desired alias: Enter W and the alias appears as shown.
Fig. 26: Autocompletion of Hosts Alias
Figure Autocompletion of Ports Alias shows the autocompletion of the ports alias configured as shown in Figure Ex-
ample Ports Alias. If multiple aliases match the letter entered, all matching aliases of the appropriate type are listed.
Click on the desired alias to select it.
Fig. 27: Autocompletion of Ports Alias
Figure Example Rule Using Aliases shows the rule created using the WebServers and WebPorts aliases. This rule is
on WAN, and allows any source to the IP addresses defined in the WebServers alias when using the ports defined in
the WebPorts alias.
Fig. 28: Example Rule Using Aliases
Hovering the mouse cursor over an alias on the Firewall > Rules page shows a tooltip displaying the contents of the
alias with the descriptions included in the alias. Figure Hovering Shows Hosts Contents shows this for the WebServers
alias and Figure Hovering Shows Ports Contents for the WebPorts alias.

Firewall Table Contents
The GUI page at Diagnostics > Tables displays the contents of tables defined by the firewall and by users.
The firewall stores aliases and other similar lists of addresses in a PF structure called a table. These tables can be
relatively static, such as the bogons list or aliases, or dynamic for things like login protection lockout, IDS/IPS, or IP
addresses exceeding connection limits.
An alias becomes a table once the firewall loads it into the ruleset.
If an alias contains a hostname the firewall populates the contents of the alias from the results of resolving hostnames
using DNS. It periodically resolves the hostnames again and updates the table accordingly if the addresses change.
Given this dynamic nature, viewing the table contents may be necessary to confirm which IP addresses are in a table
at a given time.
Viewing Tables
To view the contents of a table:
• Navigate to Diagnostics > Tables
• Select the desired table from the Table drop-down
After making a selection the page will update to display the contents of the selected table.
The icon at the end of each row in the table content removes individual entries from a table. Removing entries
is best used for dynamic tables to remove an entry before it automatically expires. Tables defined manually or by a file
will be refreshed when the system performs a filter reload, so it is best to edit an alias and remove an entry rather than
removing it from this page.

Default Tables
The firewall includes several tables by default, depending on which features are enabled:
bogons/bogonsv6
If any interface is configured with Block Bogon Networks, these tables will be present.
The page offers an Update button for the bogon tables which will immediately re-fetch the
bogons data rather than waiting for the usual monthly update.
cpzoneid*
Tables starting with this string are used internally by Captive Portal and are not meant to be managed
manually.
negate_networks
Networks for which the firewall has made policy route negation rules.
snort2c
A dynamic table containing blocked offenders from IDS/IPS packages, Snort and Suricata.
sshguard
A dynamic table containing clients that repeatedly failed login attempts for the GUI and SSH.
tonatsubnets
When using automatic outbound NAT, this table contains the list of networks for which the firewall
performs automatic outbound NAT.
Inspecting the table can aid in diagnosing tricky NAT issues to confirm if a subnet will have automatic
outbound NAT applied to its traffic.
virusprot
A dynamic table containing addresses that have exceeded defined limits on firewall rules.
vpn_networks
A list of remote networks reachable across VPNs
